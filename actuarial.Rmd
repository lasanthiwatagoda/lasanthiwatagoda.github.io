Appalachian offers an actuarial science major (not just a concentration). Appalachian’s program is the only major in the University of North Carolina system designed completely from the bottom up to prepare students to be actuaries.  It is housed in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.appstate.edu/).
